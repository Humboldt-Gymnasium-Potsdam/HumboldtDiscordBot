## Configuration documentation

The bot reads its configuration from `config.json` which is shipped with this repository
and can be found [here](../run/config.json). Additionally, the bot reads a configuration
file from `config.override.json` directly next to the `config.json` file. This override
file is merged with the other config file and overrides any values.
